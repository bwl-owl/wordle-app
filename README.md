## Features:

- Dark mode: click on the 🌚/🌞 button to toggle between dark and light themes.
- Stats: click on the 📊 button to see your total wins, losses and times you gave up.
- Giving up: click on the 🤷‍♀️ button to give up and reveal the answer. Clicking on the answer will open a new tab to the Merriam Webster's online dictionary's entry for the word.
- Restart: click on the 🔃 button to restart the game. Note that clicking on this button before you have finished the game will not count as winning, losing or giving up. The board will be cleared and the final answer will forever remain a mystery.
